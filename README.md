# Learn `Raspberry Pi`

Learn how to get started with a `Raspberry Pi`
so you can use your imagination 
to build/make *ANYTHING*!

# Why?

We _love_ the idea of tiny efficient and cost-effective computers
for specific mini-projects or general use.

Hopefully once the "chip shortage" ends
they will become easy to find/buy again. ðŸ¤ž

We were lucky (smart) enough to buy a couple of `Pis` 
for our "Smart Home" projects before the pandemic
so those are what we are using.

# What?

# Who?

Anyone can follow along.
This guide is intended for all ages/abilities.

# When?

I learned programming age 5 on a 
[BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) 
And hope to show `Pi` to our children 
when they are ready.


# How?

We intend to write a more _general_ "from scratch" guide 
in the future when we have more time
and a captive audience 
in the form of our kids. ðŸ§’
But until then we are writing 
_specific_ guides for how _we_ are using our `Raspberry Pis`.

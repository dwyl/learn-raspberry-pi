The purpose of this doc is to document our setup of our `Pi Hole`.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

We are _not_ `Pi-hole` experts.
We cannot offer any support 
to anyone 

# Why?

We decided to run a `Pi-hole` 
because:

1. Privacy - too many tracker in `Chrome`
2. Security - trackers/brokers are leaking our personal data to evil people.



# How

Using Raspberry PI Imager (`v1.7.5`), flashing `Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) to a fresh `SanDisk Ultra MicroSDHC UHS-1 Card`:

While that is writing I'm going to head over to the "networking area" of the workshop
and connect the `Raspberry PI v3 B` (ancient, but apparently more than adequate for `Pi-hole`) 
to the Switch and get everything ready so I can plug-in the `MicroSD` and get started.
